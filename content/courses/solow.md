## Introduction

This page contains some resources I've created for teaching a simplified version of the neoclassical growth model in Principles of Macroeconomics at Carleton College. It does not require calculus (and, in fact, minimal algebra) and abstracts from exogenous population growth and technological progress, except in an appendix. Within the text, there are exercises for students to develop and explain intuition, and relate the predictions of the model to both the data and the literature on "fundamental" causes of growth.  The text is accompanied by a set of Shiny applications to calculate steady state and illustrate the dynamic path of the economy.
