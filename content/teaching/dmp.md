## Introduction

This is a set of notes and accompanying Shiny application for teaching a simple, two-sided labor search and matching model. 

I originally created it for teaching ECON 331, Intermediate Macroeconomics, at Carleton College. It's based on the treatment in the first part of chapter 1 of Christopher Pissarides _Equilibrium Unemployment Theory_.
